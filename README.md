# The PsychPower package
An R package to define, assess, and describe symptom phenotypes and their frequency distribution in a sample.

# Installation

This package is currently only hosted on GitHub. The PsychPower package can be installed using the usual way:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("orduek/PsychPower")
```

# Getting Started

The vignettes demonstrate how to use the package to define phenotypes, describe and count all unique phenotypes in a sample, approximate phenotype frequency using the [poweRlaw](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/poweRlaw/index.html) package following the methods outlined by [Clauset et al, 2009](http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1062), and plot the results.
